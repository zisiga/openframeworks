## Eye of Power

### Concept

In the book ‘The Eye of Power’, Michel Foucault discusses the history of social production and organization of space. He articulates how architecture has been primarily concerned with the functionality and a modality that stems from architecture for divinity. Foucault highlights that architecture can also be used as a method of suppression. I have been thinking alot about surveillance in this time of COVID 19, and how in fear, people are less concerned about compromising their rights to privacy. I have left complacent in demanding more from the technology. This is part one of an ongoing story.

### Audience

My goal of the project is to highlight how we (as consumers) are constantly watched yet also constantly watching the time.

### How I translated my concept

I used time as a metaphor for power and used moving eyes as a symbol for how we not only keep track of time as a way to be productive.

- I started off with creating graphics and style boards.
- Drew shapes and added images to shape
- Included text library
- Animated images and text

### How I would like to develop the concept more in future iterations

There are a few additional scenes that I would have created but had challenges with changing the scene to include text from a new scene. I also had a number of additional graphics that I would like to include to future iterations. In terms of the animation I would like the sketch to involve the user in a more involved way. Currently pressing the right arrow moves the circle (clock) to clear the sceen but it would be great if for example, the orbiting eye moves faster when someone looks at the camera.
